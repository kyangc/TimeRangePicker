TimeRangePicker
===============

A scrollable time range picker, easy to understand and use.       
It's a well built fragment, you can use it by new a fragment and set it's configurations like `scrollSpeed`and `isTimeRangeDraggable`*(more features on the way)*.    
You can also set `OnTimeRangeChangeListener` to do your own things like saving the time figure and update your own UI.

Usage
---
For I don't have enough time to make it a libary, so you have to import this project as a module or just add java files into your own projects, in that way, you also need to add propereties references into your `strings.xml`,`styles.xml`,`dimens.xml`,`intergers.xml`,`colors.xml`like what I do in my project, then you can use it by newing the fragment.    
I know adding reference lines is annoying, *maybe in the future I'll post it in a more efficient way*.
